DESCRIPTION OF THIS TASK

# üìä Task 4 ‚Äì Optimization using Linear Programming (LP)

This project is part of my **CodTech Internship Task 4**, where I solved a business problem using **optimization techniques** with Python's `PuLP` library.

---

## ‚úÖ Objective

To demonstrate how to apply **Linear Programming** (LP) to a business scenario for **maximizing profit** while respecting resource constraints.

---

## üß† Problem Description

We aim to decide how many units of **Product A** and **Product B** to produce in order to **maximize total profit**, given:

- **Profit per unit**
- **Labor and material constraints**
- **Production limits**

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **PuLP** ‚Äì Linear Programming solver
- **Jupyter Notebook** ‚Äì For step-by-step demonstration and visualization

---

## üìà Features

- Defined decision variables, constraints, and objective function
- Solved the LP problem using PuLP‚Äôs built-in solver
- Displayed optimal product quantities and maximum achievable profit
- Added insights based on the solution

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. **Install PuLP (if not installed)**:
bash
pip install pulp

Open the notebook:

Launch Jupyter Notebook and open:

task4_optimization.ipynb


#Sample Output:
Optimization Result:

Produce 0.0 units of Product A

Produce 60.0 units of Product B

Maximum Profit: $1800.0

‚ö†Ô∏è Consider rechecking constraints or resource usage to utilize both products.
